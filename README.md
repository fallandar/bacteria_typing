This repository contains the data on epidemiological typing of pathogenic bacterial isolates available in Genbank and RefSeq databases. Although such data is very important for epidemiological surveillance, it is rarely available in project and sample descriptions in these databases. The aim of this project is to present such information and update it on a regular base, so that the researchers will be able to readily download the genomes of the isolates of particular sequence type or types. <p>The typing was performed in silico using PubMlst (https://pubmlst.org/organisms/) and cgMLST (https://www.cgmlst.org/ncs/schema/) typing schemes. <p> The details on database versions and software used are provided in the file info.txt
